### About
[Thinking Aloud](http://sujithjay.com) is a personal blog where I write on organizational culture, statistics, and all sorts of randomness. This blog is a presentation of learnings, ideas, and solutions I come across, and my explorations around it.

### For Potential Employers or Collaborators
This blog is a three-fold portfolio: code, technical writing, and distillations of ideas. You can use the links to my online profiles in the sidebar of the blog to contact me; while I do respond on every profile listed, I am way more responsive on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suj1th).
