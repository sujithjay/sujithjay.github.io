I was recently on the Software Engineering Daily podcast to talk about Data Engineering at Nubank.


It turned to be a great conversation on [functional data engineering](https://medium.com/@maximebeauchemin/functional-data-engineering-a-modern-paradigm-for-batch-data-processing-2327ec32c42a), the importance of testability & reproducibility in data engineering (and our approach to achieving it at scale at Nubank), thinking of dataset quality in terms of dataset-as-a-service, and my take on the history of data engineering as [a rediscovery of the table abstraction](https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1195442753389387782). Check it out [here](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/02/06/nubank-data-engineering-with-sujith-nair/).
