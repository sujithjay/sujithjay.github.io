<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe an important caveat exists to this postulate: the physical capital necessary for the production &amp; innovation of the resource should have low-cost access &amp; wide distribution. I will try &amp; explore this caveat a bit. <a href="https://t.co/p57V70PiCr">https://t.co/p57V70PiCr</a></p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725344249851910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will use the case of the Pharmaceutical industry. Modern drug discovery is a patent-heavy process, which should make it a ripe candidate for open source disruption. But this has not been the case, yet.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725347718594560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My argument for why this is so is the concentrated nature of the physical asset (lab infrastructure, capital for clinical trials) needed for innovation in drug discovery - it is limited to large pharmaceutical firms and some university departments.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725351107551232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The concentrated nature of the physical asset ensures the opportunity cost of losing out on innovation that could have been garnered by the resource as a commons, is very low. This, in turn, reduces the effective implementation cost of property for the resource. Hence, patents!</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725354064601088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
