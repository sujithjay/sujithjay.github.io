<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The effective implementation cost of property for a resource in a patent-heavy industry is a combination of two factors:<br>1. the (nominal) cost of a patent.<br>2. the opportunity cost of losing out on innovation that could have been garnered by the resource as a commons.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053238425351000064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OTOH, the efficiency of utilisation of a resource for a firm in a patent-heavy industry = the share of the value created by the resource which the firm can capture. This is lower for a commons resource vs a patented resource.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053238428303847425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How much lower? And, is this loss covered for by relinquishing the cost of property implementation? A traditional view on this would answer NO.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053238431323770880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The emergence &amp; continued flourish of the COSS industry, however, is a proof to the contrary. We can draw parallels between proprietary software &amp; patents (both are moats around information resources with the abject intent of increasing an entity&#39;s share of resource utilisation).</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053238434410549248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe a drift from patents to commons will result as the realisation of the high hidden cost to implementation of patents offsets the scepticism to the commercial viability of open source.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe an important caveat exists to this postulate: the physical capital necessary for the production &amp; innovation of the resource should have low-cost access &amp; wide distribution. I will try &amp; explore this caveat a bit. <a href="https://t.co/p57V70PiCr">https://t.co/p57V70PiCr</a></p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725344249851910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will use the case of the Pharmaceutical industry. Modern drug discovery is a patent-heavy process, which should make it a ripe candidate for open source disruption. But this has not been the case, yet.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725347718594560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My argument for why this is so is the concentrated nature of the physical asset (lab infrastructure, capital for clinical trials) needed for innovation in drug discovery - it is limited to large pharmaceutical firms and some university departments.</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725351107551232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The concentrated nature of the physical asset ensures the opportunity cost of losing out on innovation that could have been garnered by the resource as a commons, is very low. This, in turn, reduces the effective implementation cost of property for the resource. Hence, patents!</p>&mdash; Sujith Jay Nair (@suj1th) <a href="https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1053725354064601088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
