Locked down in Bristol, England. It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.

I am working on the following:
- As a healing measure to the lockdown-induced fatigue, I have restarted a long-lost habit of writing short-stories.

- My endeavour to write longer essays, inspired by ["All Art is Propaganda"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3339527-all-art-is-propaganda), has been a failure so far. Partially-written drafts are piling up like debris.

- I have been reading more literature on engineering management. Started with [Strategize](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29336329-strategize), and now on [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45303387-an-elegant-puzzle)

- I am building a tiny sql compiler, as a project to teach myself `rust` & query compilation. This is the third in a series of tiny `rust` projects I have taken up this year.
