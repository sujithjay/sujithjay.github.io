## Chapter 1 - On the Experience of Moral Confusion
- There is a moral quandary.
  - Paying back borrowed money is morally right.
  - The habit of lending money, i.e. usury, is sin.
- All revolutions are of the form: 'Cancel the debts and redistribute the land'.
- Our contemporary moral and religious vocabulary is borne out of finance: redemption, reckoning, guilt, sin, freedom among others. Our vocabulary of right and wrong is shaped by it.
- The central question of the book is: what, precisely, does it mean to say that our sense of morality and justice is reduced to the language of a business deal?
- A debt is the obligation to pay a certain sum of money. Thus, debt is a fungible obligation.
- There is a link between the quantifiability of debt and the presence of a threat of violence.

## Chapter 2 - The Myth of Barter
- Economists see three functions of money: medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.
- Money as medium of exchange is treated as primary, and how it replaced barter is a founding myth of economics. In this myth, money replaced barter because it eliminates the problem of double coincidence of wants.
- Lewis Henry Morgan, in his descriptions of the Six Nations of the Iriquois, says that the main economic institution of the Iriquois were longhouses where most goods were stockpiled and then allocated by women's councils.
- Caroline Humphrey: 'No example of barter system, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence of money from it.'
