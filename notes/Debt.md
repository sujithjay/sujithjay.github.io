## Chapter 1 - On the Experience of Moral Confusion
- There is a moral quandary.
  - Paying back borrowed money is morally right.
  - The habit of lending money, i.e. usury, is sin.
- All revolutions are of the form: 'Cancel the debts and redistribute the land'.
- Our contemporary moral and religious vocabulary is borne out of finance: redemption, reckoning, guilt, sin, freedom among others. Our vocabulary of right and wrong is shaped by it.
- The central question of the book is: what, precisely, does it mean to say that our sense of morality and justice is reduced to the language of a business deal?
- A debt is the obligation to pay a certain sum of money. Thus, debt is a fungible obligation.
- There is a link between the quantifiability of debt and the presence of a threat of violence.
