## Chapter 2 - Cities as Labour Markets
- Firms and Households relate via the labor market. The labor market obliges firms and households to locate at ‘commute-able’ distances.
- OTOH, they compete for land use.
- Thus, there is a trade-off between land consumption and commute distance.
- The Model trip patterns in metropolitan areas take the forms of :
  - Monocentric
  - Dispersed
  - Composite
  - Urban Village
- The efficient operation of labor markets requires mobility and affordability.
  - Firms and Households have the freedom to stay put or migrate at will.
  - Travel within the city remains fast and cheap.
  - Real estate is affordable that it does not distort the allocation of labor.

## Chapter 4 - Spatial Distribution of Land Prices and Densities
- Projections of population density is a necessary input into design; but projections should not be frozen into land use regulations.
- High land prices —> High Density; not the other way around.
- Standard Urban Model
- The SUM works for a acentric city with no CBD, since proximity to centroid provides a better access to labor market.
- The SUM can estimate the urban-agriculture boundary, and how far a city expands.
- There will develop two urban-agriculture boundaries:
  - x1, where urban land price meets agricultural land prices
  - x2, where urban land price meets agricultural land price + cost of infrastructure
- In the range between x2 to x1, informal development occurs. The cause of informal development is the same in developed and developing economies: poorly conceived land use regulations that do not take into account the income of poor households.

## Chapter 5 - Mobility
- Mobility is the ability to choose among jobs and amenities offered in a city with commute time < 1 hour.
- Commuting (for work) forms a small fraction (14%-19%) of trips, yet provide maximum economic viability to the city. Hence, it is used as a proxy for mobility.
- Increasing population density decreases distance between any A & B points in the city, but need not reduce commute times. It can also increase congestion. Commuting time depends also on transport mode, transport speed, area under roads, etc.
- The objective of urban transport is to increase mobility to maximise the effective size of labour markets. Congestion and pollution are constraints to it (but they are not the objectives).
- Promoting the constraints of reducing congestion and pollution to the objective makes planners to fragment the city's labour market into sectors where jobs and housing are matched (i.e. a resident of a sector works in the same sector). However, such fragmentation does not decrease average trip-length because:
  - all workers in a household cannot not find employment in the same neighbourhood.
  - when a worker changes employment, they do not change residence since moving homes has a high transaction cost.
  - proximity to work is not the only consideration when choosing a residence.
- A measure for mobility can be computed in two stages:
  - Calculating the number of jobs accessible from every census tract within a selected time limit. This is accessibility of the census tract.
  - Calculating the worker-weighted average of the accessibility of all census tracts to form the mobility index of the metropolitan area.
- Commuting time = Travel time + Access time. Reducing access time, rather than improving speed of travel, should be a priority. Access time is also why public transports take longer than a private vehicle in point-to-point commute.
- Congestion is measured using TTI - Travel Time Index - ratio of travel time in peak periods vs. travel time in free-flow conditions.
