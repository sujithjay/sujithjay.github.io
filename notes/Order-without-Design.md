## Chapter 2
- Firms and Households relate via the labor market. The labor market obliges firms and households to locate at ‘commute-able’ distances.
- OTOH, they compete for land use.
- Thus, there is a trade-off between land consumption and commute distance.
- The Model trip patterns in metropolitan areas take the forms of :
  - Monocentric
  - Dispersed
  - Composite
  - Urban Village
- The efficient operation of labor markets requires mobility and affordability.
  - Firms and Households have the freedom to stay put or migrate at will.
  - Travel within the city remains fast and cheap.
  - Real estate is affordable that it does not distort the allocation of labor.


## Chapter 4
- Projections of population density is a necessary input into design; but projections should not be frozen into land use regulations.
- High land prices —> High Density; not the other way around.
- Standard Urban Model
- The SUM works for a acentric city with no CBD, since proximity to centroid provides a better access to labor market.
- The SUM can estimate the urban-agriculture boundary, and how far a city expands.
- There will develop two urban-agriculture boundaries:
  - x1, where urban land price meets agricultural land prices
  - x2, where urban land price meets agricultural land price + cost of infrastructure
- In the range between x2 to x1, informal development occurs. The cause of informal development is the same in developed and developing economies: poorly conceived land use regulations that do not take into account the income of poor households.
