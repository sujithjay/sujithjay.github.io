# Sujith Jay Nair

Hi, I am Sujith - a data engineer working at Nubank, where I design, build, and operate data systems. Data infrastructure is an interest & I sometimes talk about it: a recent talk is on [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/02/06/nubank-data-engineering-with-sujith-nair/). I love to write - fiction & tech. I put up a small cross-section of my technical writing on [my blog](https://sujithjay.com). But, stuff other than software does creep in to the blog time to time. I am yet to find the courage (and a publisher) to publish my fiction.

## How I Work
I have zero memory for certain details: so it makes sense for me to write & doodle. Writing provides a fallback memory to my mind , and some rigor to my thoughts. I like just enough process [1]. I am also pro-checklists. ✅
