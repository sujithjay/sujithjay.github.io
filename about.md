title: About the Author

My name is Sujith Jay Nair. I am currently a data engineer at [Logistimo](http://www.logistimo.com). I earned a Masters in systems engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology at Varanasi. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Mumbai in computer engineering. I am a contributor to multiple open-source communities; notably Apache Spark, Impala and ScalaNLP. My interests revolve around design & operations of large-scale data-intensive systems.

I have a thorough background in computer science, but I also try to think and write on organizational culture, statistics, and macro-economics. This blog is a presentation of learnings, ideas, and solutions I come across, and my explorations around it.


## For Potential Employers or Collaborations
This blog is a three-fold portfolio: code, technical writing, and distillations of ideas from computer science and mathematics. You can use the links to my online profiles in the sidebar to contact me.
