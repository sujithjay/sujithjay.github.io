title: About
---
I am Sujith Jay Nair. I am employed at Nubank in Berlin as a data engineer. I earned a Masters in systems engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Mumbai in computer engineering. I am a contributor to multiple open-source communities; notably Apache Spark, and Apache Iceberg. My interests revolve around design & operations of large-scale data-intensive systems.

I write about computer science in general, and data systems in particular; some essays talk about organizational culture within fast-paced organizations,some have a little bit of statistics, and there are others about all sorts of randomness. This blog is a presentation of my learnings, ideas I have, solutions I come across, notes & jottings on certain topics; in short, my explorations for knowledge.
