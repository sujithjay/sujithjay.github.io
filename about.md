I am an engineer at Nubank, where I design, build, and operate data systems and explore ways to democratise the use of data within the organization.

I recently spent a few years at Logistimo where we built a data platform from scratch to process & generate business intelligence from volumes of data from immunisation supply-chains in India, along with public health supply-chains in Zambia, Myanmar, Indonesia and others.

I am a contributor to multiple open-source communities; notably Apache Spark, and Apache Iceberg.

Having worked with data systems for some years now, I am of the opinion that although evolution in data systems have been cyclical, and certain newer trends are plain [rediscoveries](https://twitter.com/suj1th/status/1195442753389387782), we are moving [out of the tar pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) of state & complexity with every iteration. Definite optimism, FTW!

I write about computer science in general, and data systems in particular; some essays talk about organizational culture within fast-paced organizations, some have a little bit of statistics, and there are others about all sorts of randomness. This blog is a presentation of my learnings, ideas I have, solutions I come across, notes & jottings on certain topics. I am trying to be wrong in public, so that I can be less wrong about them.


## To Potential Employers or Collaborators
This blog is a portfolio of code, writing, and ideas. You can use the links to my online profiles in the sidebar to contact me; while I do respond on every profile listed, I am way more responsive on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suj1th).
