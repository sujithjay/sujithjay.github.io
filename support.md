This blog exists for you, the reader. You can provide me support in myriad ways; I list some of them below:

### Share
Sharing my articles increases readership. Increased readership, hopefully, leads to more conversations. This is immense for me, and it is my biggest satisfaction in writing.

### Become a Patron
Although your viewership is crucial, I receive no monetary benefit out of it (since I choose to keep my blog ad-free). If you believe you have gotten something out of my articles, you could consider becoming a patron on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/suj1th).
